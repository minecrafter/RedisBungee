# Often, the RedisBungee commands are desired, but in some cases someone may wish to
# override the commands using another plugin.

# If you are just denying access to the commands, RedisBungee uses the default BungeeCord
# permissions - just deny them and access will be denied.
#
# Please note that with build 787+, most commands overridden by RedisBungee were moved to
# modules, and these must be disabled or overridden yourself.
